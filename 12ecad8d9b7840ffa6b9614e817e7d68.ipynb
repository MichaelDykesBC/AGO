Historically we have published a single large service with over 700 layers. The single service will be replaced by multiple smaller services published by schema. Duplicate Map Image Layer items will also be deprecated in favour of the corresponding authoritative Feature Layer items. We are now ready to implement the changes.\n### https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/data/geobc/bcs_map_hub_-_change_notice_and_additional_20210520_1.pdf\n#### Michael Dykes (Michael.Dykes@gov.bc.ca)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Import required libraries/modules\nimport json,requests\nfrom ipywidgets import *\nfrom difflib import SequenceMatcher\nfrom arcgis.gis import GIS\nfrom arcgis.mapping import WebMap\n\n# Create connection to AGO \"home\" works for AGO Notebooks, otherwise need to change to something like \"gis = GIS('https://governmentofbc.maps.arcgis.com/',username,password)\"\ngis = GIS(\"home\")","execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":"/opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages/arcgis/gis/__init__.py:430: UserWarning: You are logged on as MDYKES.BC with an administrator role, proceed with caution.\n  self.users.me.username)\n","name":"stderr"}]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Search AGO for Web Maps owned by you, max 500 items (if you need more then change this)\nfor item in gis.content.search(query=\"* AND \\  owner:\" + gis.users.me.username, item_type=\"Web Map\", max_items=500):\n    # Open item as Web Map Object\n    WebMap_Object = WebMap(item)\n    # Iterate through Web Map layers\n    for layer in WebMap_Object.layers:\n        # Check if you can access URL key from layer JSON (sometimes you can't)\n        if 'url' in layer:\n            # Check if layer has the old service layer url\n            if \"mpcm/bcgwpub/MapServer\" in layer['url']:\n                # Sometimes itemIDs don't exist in a layer JSON, I belive this happens when you have multiple copies of the same feature layer in the same map?
